# Testing

- Since this project uses Chainlink oracles testing the project requires an infura/alchemy/geth node

- To set your node add the `GETH_NODE` env variable in `.env`

- Provided node will be used to spawn a local mainnet fork using ganache-core

> npm install -g truffle

> npm install

> truffle test

 

# Additions to the original design specs:

-  `_addToken(address tokenAddress, address oracleAddress)`

- adds the corresponding ChainLink oracle address

-  `delegatePausable(uint streamId, address delegate) onlyPayerOrDelegated(streamId)`

- Delegates pausable capability to `address delegate`

-  `claimable (uint streamId)`

- returns accrued amount in USD (18 decimals) for `streamId`

-  `claimableToken (uint streamId)`

- returns accrued amount in `token` value using Chainlink' oracle

-  `getStreamsCount()`

- return total no. of streams: useful for looping through `streams` using `getStream(id)`

## Events emitted

- `event  newStream(uint id, address payer, address payee, uint usdAmount)` 
	- Emitted after successful `createStream`, useful for indexing purposes
- `event  tokenAdded(address tokenAddress, address oracleAddress)`
	- Emitted when the owner adds support for a new token
- `event  claimed(uint id, uint usdAmount, uint tokenAmount);` 
	Emitted when a user claims his accrued amount, tracks both the value in USD and in `token`
  

# Design specs

# Outcomes

  

- A payment stream is a per-Ethereum-block drip stream of abstract USD to a payee address.

- A payer may create, start, or stop payment streams to a payee address.

- Each payment stream is associated with a token <XYZ>, and has received an ERC20 approval from the funding address.

- Payees may Claim the unlocked, unclaimed USD balance of the payment stream.

- A Claim will consult an on-chain price oracle USDC/XYZ, calculate the amount of XYZ coins to be paid, and transfer that amount of XYZ to the payee.

  

# Implementation

  

## createStream(payee address, payee USD amount, payer token, funding address, end time)

  

Create a new payment stream from payer to payee. Funds may be from any account; funding account must approve this contract debiting this amount.

  

## pauseStream(stream ID)

  

Stop the drip.

  

## unpauseStream(stream ID)

  

Restart the drip.

  

## setPayee(stream ID, address)

  

Change stream payee address.

  

## setFundingRate(stream ID, USD amount, end time)

  

Change stream funding rate.

  

## setFundingAddress(stream ID, address)

  

Change stream funding address.

  

## claim(stream ID)

  

Payee receives nnnn.nn XYZ tokens, derived from a calculation of accumulated-but-not-claimed USD balance. The amount of XYZ tokens is calculated from an on-chain XYZ/USDC price oracle at claim time.
